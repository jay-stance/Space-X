this is a shooting game created with pure javascript(Canvas). I just wanted to play arround with Canvas and so decided to create a game with it

Unlike some other Canvas games, 'Space-X' has many interesting features thea make it looki like a real game(with a lot of game effects).

Without speaking much, you can fork, clone or download it and ENJOY!

##Don't forget to follow me, if you like my projects and I am looking forward to creating more interesting ones
